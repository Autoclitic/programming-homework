 homework for my university class


some notes:
 The mushroom.py is not currently correct in the machine learning. It will be fixed sometime in the future.
 The random walk most likely does not give the completely correct answer. It is something that I will be working on. 
 The picture.py is to show an understanding of basic color manipulation.
 The sorting.py is to show an understanding of algorithmic sorting.
